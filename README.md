## node-mongoose

I used this server Modular Software Design Pattern code.

To run the project in development / locally, use the script in your local command.

```
npm run start:dev
```

To run the project in production, use the script. (note: As i used TypeScript for the project, firstly you have to transpile the project using tsc command or npm run start:dev)

```
npm run start:prod
```
